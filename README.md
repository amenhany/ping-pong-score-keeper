# Ping Pong Score Keeper 🏓

This website was developed as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp, but instead of using a CSS Framework, I decided to use raw CSS to emulate the same look, as practice.

The aim of this website is to provide a score keeper for a 2-player Ping Pong game, but I also added an ability to increase the number of players, the target/winning score and a system to win by 2 (you have to lead the second largest score by 2 points, even if you passed the target score)


## Instructions 🔧

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amenhany/ping-pong-score-keeper.git
